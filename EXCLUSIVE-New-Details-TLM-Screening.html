      <p> <span class="desctext">Halle Bailey and Jonah Howard King in 'The Little Mermaid'</span><p>
    <p>Last week, Disney's highly anticipated upcoming live action remake of the 1992 classic 'The Little Mermaid' had a private screening on the Disney lot. The film stars Halle Bailey as 'Ariel' and Melissa McCarthy as 'Ursula'. It is set to release in theaters on May 26th 2023.<p>


      <p>While not at the test screening ourselves, Movie News Plus did have eyes there and at the studio and we are willing to spill a little tea for you<p>
        
        
        </p>Stuff We've Said before:</p>
          
        </p>We scooped some stuff on our Twitter before the teaser came out and it was proven to be correct but here it is again for those who did not see</p> 
        </p>Halls's hair is a little more orange-ish and a little less vibrant than the original but it still looks super good! She also wears a pink dress during the film but we are unable to confirm if it is her ballgown.
        
        </p>Sebastian looks like a crab, but, his face actually looks a little like a rectangle. (A little more "boxy" than the animated version)
        
        </p> All of the animals are actually realistic and the way they talk looks convincing but they still capture the magic of the original.
        
        
        </p> Also, we have heard from trustworthy sources that Disney is developing an animated Little Mermaid series called ‘Ariel’ but they are not sure if it’s related to the remake or not.
        
        
        
        <p> </b>Details on the Screening:</b>
        
          <p>The movie scored very well, In the high 80's, at the screening. It scored the same, or a little more, than the 2019 adaptation of 'Aladdin' did at it's test screening. 'Aladdin' had an amazing response from audiences during test screenings and went on to gross over a billion dollars at the box office, which is a really good sign for 'The Little Mermaid'.
        
        
        
            <p>If you don't know what a test screening score is, here is how it works:
        
              <p>Sometimes studios will pull people from the LA area in their target demographic to screen it but in this case, and for most Disney movies, it was a closed screening so the people who saw it worked for the Walt Disney Company.
        
                <p>Studio Execs talk about the movie before it plays and tells them that some parts like music, sfx and vfx are not finished
        
                They watch the movie
        
                <p>They get a sheet of paper to fill out with questions. One question is would you recommend this movie to a friend. The % of people that answer yes to that is the test screening score.
        
        They get put into groups to talk about what they liked/disliked about the movie. The conversions are recorded so that the studio can improve the movie later on.
        
        
        
        
        
        </p>The audience really liked the songs and clapped at the end of a few, but there were mixed reactions to some the new songs especially the Sebastian and Scuttle rap. Some people said that the rap was their least favorite part of the movie but others really liked it.
        
        </p>The audience also clapped after 'Part Of your World', 'Kiss The Girl', and the end wedding scene.
        
        </p>They also really liked the 'Under the Sea' scene which was super colorful and full of energy! Lots more in that scene than there was in the original. Lots of the underwater stuff was described to me as sort of neon especially Ursula's (who glows in the dark) cave!
        
        <p>


        </p>
        <p></b>New Tea:</b>
        
        
          <p>Like we said on Twitter last week, the movie runs at around 2:20 long which is around an hour longer than it's  animated counterpart. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate. No phones or electronic devices are allowed into test screenings and discussion groups occur afterwards so its hard to actually tell.
        
        So what is taking up all of this time?? 
        
        
        -  Extended underwater sequences. Most of the first act takes place underwater (minus parts like fathoms below, shipwreck, etc). We get to do some exploring in Atlantica and get to know her sisters more + more songs
        
        
        
        -  Royal Family. Yeah you heard that right. We get to see some more stuff regarding Prince Eric and his family, especially his Mom. They have a relationship sort of like Ariel and Triton.
        
        
        
        -  Exploring the on land. We get to see a little bit more of the village and the kingdom which is never actually said where it takes place, but it is defiantly the Caribbean. Some audience members at the screening felt that this part dragged on for too long, so they may cut some of it out.
        
        
        
        -  Extended end fight sequence. The end fight is much longer than the original and Ariel does a lot more this time! Sort of like the 2019 'Aladdin' end fight, no bloody action but a good end to the story.
        
        
        
        -  Honeymoon scene. We get to see a wedding and a honeymoon scene which, if I recall correctly, was not in the original film.
        
        
        
        The movie also includes 4 brand new songs that were not in the 1989 version. A Sebastian and Scuttle Rap duet, a new King Triton song (he has a green tail by the way), new Ariel song (while on land!!), and a new song for Mr. Prince Eric.All of these spoilers were released to boosters on our Discord server early and more will be coming exclusively for them soon!
        
        
        
        So what are your thoughts on this tea? We know that we will be seeing this film opening day!
